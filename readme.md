## Overview

This is a replication and example of the homework in which students were assigned to create an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills learned in unit 12. The app takes in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. This app fufills the bonus task, tracking product sales across your store's departments and then providing a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store

## Further Reading, Highly Recommended

1. UML
    1. Tutorialspoint' page is pretty good, I have it bookmarked: 
    2. https://www.tutorialspoint.com/uml/
    3. You'll find it to be overkill for just about anything you do, but the benefit of understanding it is that you can utilize the lessons and diagrams learned. For massive projects however, having good, clean diagrams are worth their weight in gold.
2. Planning
    1. https://www.codeconquest.com/programming-projects/
    2. https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/good-practices/a/planning-a-programming-project
    3. If need be, I'll be glad to do an indepth-lecture on this one
